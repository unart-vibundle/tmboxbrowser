mbox is a widely used format to store e-mails. Thunderbird uses it too.

Features
    - Show an index of e-mails contained in a mbox file
    - Mark e-mails as read and don't show them again in the index
    - View e-mails
        - display single parts of a multipart message
        - decode quoted printables
        - filter html mails through an external program; in the default 
          setup, this requires "w3m" (g:tmboxbrowser_convert_html)
        - view base64 encoded attachments; this also requires "base64" 
          (g:tmboxbrowser_convert_base64) to be installed
            - if viki (vimscript #861) is installed, use 
              VikiOpenSpecialFile()
            - otherwise the file will be opened with 
              g:netrw_browsex_viewer

:TMBoxBrowser[!] [FILE]
    Open a index list with the e-mails in the currently opened mbox.
    With [!], read items are displayed too. In this mode, no e-mails are 
    marked as read.
    If [FILE] is given, the file is (newly) edited.
    I.e. if you open a mbox, mark all items as read and then want to 
    browse the file again, you'll have to type>

        :TMBoxBrowser! %

    Alternatively, press <c-t> in the list view to show/hide read mails.

:TMBoxSelect[!]
    Show a list of mbox files (as defined in g:tmboxbrowser_path). 
    Open a mbox & call :TMBoxBrowser.
